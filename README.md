#CLMS Webinar: Your Toolbox for Vegetation Indices: A Hands-On HR-VPP Webinar 

##This is the reporitory of Jupyter Notebooks for the development of low-level Vegetation Indices and Biophysical Parameters. 
These datasets are not longer maintained in the context of the Vegetation Phenology and Productivity (HR-VPP) therefore this repository aims to provide the tools needed to calculate these variables independently using Sentinel-2 data. 

The webinar will provide guidance on how to calculate: 

 [Leaf Area Index (LAI)]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/copernicus-land/HRVPP-VIs/blob/main/openEO_notebooks/LAI.ipynb)).
 [Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR)](https://github.com/copernicus-land/HRVPP-VIs/blob/main/openEO_notebooks/FAPAR.ipynb).
 [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) ]([https://pages.github.com/](http://github.com/copernicus-land/HRVPP-VIs/blob/main/openEO_notebooks/NDVI.ipynb)).
 [Plant Phenology Index (PPI) ](https://pages.github.com/).
