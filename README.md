# Toolbox for Vegetation Indices and Biophysical Parameters.

## This is the reporitory of Jupyter Notebooks for the development of low-level Vegetation Indices and Biophysical Parameters. 
These datasets are not longer maintained in the context of the CLMS Vegetation Phenology and Productivity (HR-VPP) therefore this repository aims to provide the tools needed to calculate these variables independently using Sentinel-2 data. 


* [Leaf Area Index (LAI)](https://github.com/copernicus-land/HRVPP-VIs/blob/main/openEO_notebooks/LAI.ipynb).
* [Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR)](https://github.com/copernicus-land/HRVPP-VIs/blob/main/openEO_notebooks/FAPAR.ipynb).
* [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) ](http://github.com/copernicus-land/HRVPP-VIs/blob/main/openEO_notebooks/NDVI.ipynb).
* [Plant Phenology Index (PPI) ](https://pages.github.com/).
